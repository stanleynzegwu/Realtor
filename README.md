A web-based real estate platform that allows users to conveniently buy and sell properties, and also offers building painting services for users to easily request and hire professional painters. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive tools, navigating the real estate market has never been easier, and users can achieve their desired outcomes quickly.

The platform comes with a range of functionalities that enhance the user experience. For instance, admins can perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for properties, blog posts, and offers. They can also add users and grant admin rights. Users can write reviews, and as an admin, you have the ability to choose which reviews should be displayed on the website. You can favorite reviews that you want to display, but you cannot edit honest reviews made by users. This feature allows you to curate the reviews and present the best user experience possible.

To simplify the process of creating content and keeping users engaged, I used OpenAI's Text-Davinci-003 model to generate blog posts with ease. With this feature, admins can write a prompt and receive a well-written blog post, ensuring that the website is always up-to-date with fresh and relevant content. In addition, I used the model for AI editing on the create offer page, where admins can click "AI Edit" to enhance the offer description and make it more captivating.

Another impressive feature of the app is the ability for admins to send emails directly from within the platform. This feature not only simplifies the process of replying to messages but also enables admins to send newsletters to subscribers with ease. To achieve this, I used Nodemailer, a powerful library that makes sending emails from Node.js applications incredibly easy. With Nodemailer, we can send plain text and HTML messages, attach files, and even embed inline images in our emails.
For state management, I utilized the combination of React Context and useReducer. This approach enables easy sharing of data across components and simplifies the state management process.
Overall, the MERN app is a comprehensive and powerful tool that streamlines the real estate market and provides a range of functionalities that make buying and selling properties a breeze. I am confident that this app will be of great benefit to users and admins alike.
